| ----- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | `constructor` | Runs once at deployment                             |

| 6     | `internal`    | Callable only from inside the contract              |
| 7     | `private`     | Callable only within the same contract              |
| 8     | `view`/`pure` | Read-only or logic-only functions, includes getters |

## üî§ General Naming Conventions
| Element               | Convention                              | Example                         |

## üß™ Testing Style (Based on Cyfrin‚Äôs FundMe)

### > üìÅ Example: `test/FundMeTest.t.sol`

This is a **working and correct** test file for your `FundMe` contract, considering:

* Use of a **real mock contract** (`MockV3Aggregator`);
* Proper passing of the mock address to the `FundMe` constructor;
* **No use of `vm.broadcast`**, since you're calling `run()` inside tests ‚Äî `broadcast` is only for real deployments, not test environments;
* Avoiding the attempt to call `DeployFundMe.run()` as a `view`, which fails if `run()` includes `startBroadcast`.

---

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {FundMe} from "../src/FundMe.sol";
import {MockV3Aggregator} from "../src/test/mocks/MockV3Aggregator.sol";

contract FundMeTest is Test {
    FundMe public fundMe;
    MockV3Aggregator public mockV3Aggregator;

    address public OWNER = address(1); // any valid address

    function setUp() public {
        vm.startPrank(OWNER); // pretend OWNER is deploying

        mockV3Aggregator = new MockV3Aggregator(8, 3000e8);
        fundMe = new FundMe(address(mockV3Aggregator));

        vm.stopPrank(); // stop impersonation
    }

    function testMinimumDollarIsFive() public {
        assertEq(fundMe.MINIMUM_USD(), 5e18);
    }

    function testOwnerIsDeployer() public {
        assertEq(fundMe.getOwner(), OWNER);
    }

    function testPriceFeedVersion() public {
        uint256 version = fundMe.getVersion();
        assertEq(version, mockV3Aggregator.version());
    }

    function testFundFailsBelowMinimum() public {
        vm.prank(OWNER);

        // 1 ETH = 3000 USD ‚Üí 5 USD ‚âà 0.001666 ETH
        // Sending 0.001 ETH should revert
        vm.expectRevert();

        uint256 balanceAfter = OWNER.balance;

        assertGt(balanceAfter, balanceBefore); // funds returned
    }

    function testWithdrawFailsIfNotOwner() public {
        vm.prank(OWNER);
        fundMe.fund{value: 0.01 ether}();

        address notOwner = address(2);
        vm.prank(notOwner);

        vm.expectRevert(); // should fail due to onlyOwner
        fundMe.withdraw();
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}
```

#### üîç What this file tests:

* Initializes `FundMe` with a real `MockV3Aggregator`;
* Fakes that `OWNER` deployed the contract;
* Validates:

  * the `MINIMUM_USD` constant;
  * ownership behavior;
  * version from price feed;
  * rejection of underfunding;
  * successful funding above the threshold;
  * owner-only withdrawals;
  * rejection of unauthorized withdrawals.

---

#### üîß Bonus: if you want to use `DeployFundMe`

If you'd still like to use `DeployFundMe`, you'd need to **move the deployment logic out of `run()`** into a separate function like `createFundMe()`, and **avoid `startBroadcast`** inside that method.

This way, tests can call the deployment logic without `broadcast` conflicts.

#### ChatGPT's suggestion for the later self research:

Let me know if you'd like a clean refactor of `DeployFundMe` to make it testable this way ‚Äî happy to show it.

### üîß Common `vm.` Cheat Sheet for Foundry Tests

| Command                     | Description                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `vm.prank(address)`         | Next call is made from `address` (changes `msg.sender`)                  |
| `vm.startPrank(address)`    | Start a prank for multiple calls from `address`                          |
| `vm.stopPrank()`            | Stop a running `startPrank()`                                            |
| `vm.expectRevert()`         | Expect the next call to revert (optionally with a specific message)      |
| `vm.deal(address, amount)`  | Set ETH balance of `address`                                             |
| `vm.warp(timestamp)`        | Fast-forward block timestamp (e.g., `vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days)`) |
| `vm.roll(blockNumber)`      | Change the current block number                                          |
| `vm.mockCall(...)`          | Mock a low-level external contract call                                  |
| `vm.recordLogs()`           | Start recording logs for event testing                                   |
| `vm.load(addr, slot)`       | Load raw storage from a contract                                         |
| `vm.store(addr, slot, val)` | Write raw storage into a contract (use carefully!)                       |

---

### üìå Example ‚Äî `vm.mockCall(...)`

```solidity
vm.mockCall(
    address(mockFeed),
    abi.encodeWithSelector(AggregatorV3Interface.latestRoundData.selector),
    abi.encode(0, 2000e8, 0, 0, 0) // mock price data
);
```

* Mocks a call to `latestRoundData()`
* Useful when you don‚Äôt want to deploy or configure a real oracle mock
* Can simulate any external contract call returning controlled values

### üé≤ Fuzzing 101 ‚Äî Intro to Property-Based Testing

#### üß™ What is Fuzzing?

Fuzzing generates **random inputs** to test your functions under a wide range of scenarios. It helps uncover edge cases you might not think of manually.

#### üöß Tools:

| Command                  | Description                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `vm.assume(condition)`   | Filter out invalid or unwanted inputs in a fuzz test |
| `bound(input, min, max)` | Force a fuzzed value to stay within a specific range |

---

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Example Fuzz Test with `vm.assume` + `bound`

```solidity
function test_FuzzFund(uint256 amount) public {
    // Only allow fuzzed inputs in the valid range
    vm.assume(amount > 1e18 && amount < 100 ether);

    vm.prank(user);
    fundMe.fund{value: amount}();

    uint256 funded = fundMe.getAddressToAmountFunded(user);
    assertEq(funded, amount);
}
```

Or using `bound()` instead:

```solidity
function test_FuzzFund(uint256 amount) public {
    amount = bound(amount, 1 ether, 100 ether);

    vm.prank(user);
    fundMe.fund{value: amount}();

    assertEq(fundMe.getAddressToAmountFunded(user), amount);
}
```

---

#### üìå **Pro Tips:**

* Use `assume` to avoid invalid test cases.
* `bound` is simpler for numeric ranges ‚Äî especially when testing balance limits or loop conditions.
* Fuzzing is most powerful when testing **invariants**, like "the contract‚Äôs balance should never go below 0."

---

### üß¨ Invariant Testing (Property Testing)

**Invariant tests** check that **a condition always holds**‚Äîno matter what sequence of actions the fuzzer tries.

#### üîç Use Case:

Instead of testing one function with random inputs, Foundry will **call many functions in random order** and check if a rule (invariant) is ever violated.

#### üß™ Example:

```solidity
contract MyInvariantTest is Test {
    MyContract my;

    function setUp() public {
        my = new MyContract();
    }

    function invariant_totalIsAlwaysNonNegative() public {
        assert(my.total() >= 0);
    }
}
```

#### üîÅ Fuzzer will:

* Randomly call public/external functions on `my`
* After each sequence, it checks that `total() >= 0`

üìå Great for catching **unexpected side effects** and **state corruption**.

---

### üß© `cheatcodes.json` (Cheatcodes Documentation)

Foundry provides powerful tools for testing via **VM cheatcodes**, like `vm.prank`, `vm.mockCall`, etc.

üìÅ The file [`cheatcodes.json`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/) is an **official list of all cheatcodes**, including:

| Cheatcode         | Purpose                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `vm.expectRevert` | Expect a revert during a test       |
| `vm.deal`         | Set ETH balance of an address       |
| `vm.warp`         | Set the next block‚Äôs timestamp      |
| `vm.mockCall`     | Mock external calls and return data |
| `vm.assume`       | Filter invalid fuzzed inputs        |

üõ† You can access the full doc here:

## :brain: **What is a REPL?**

**REPL** = **Read‚ÄìEval‚ÄìPrint Loop**

It‚Äôs an interactive environment where you:

1. **Type code** (e.g., `2 + 2`)
2. It **executes** that code
3. It **prints** the result (e.g., `4`)
4. It **waits** for your next command

---

## üõ† **What is Chisel (for Solidity)?**

**Chisel** is a REPL for **Solidity** ‚Äî like a **Solidity playground in your terminal**.

* Great for **trying out small snippets**, like variables, structs, math, mappings, etc.
* No need to **create full smart contracts**, write `.sol` files, or compile anything.
* Useful for **debugging**, **learning**, or **quick testing**.

---

### :bulb: Analogy

* Python ‚Üí `python` in terminal
* JavaScript ‚Üí `node` REPL
* Solidity ‚Üí `chisel`

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Example usage

```bash
chisel
```

Then in the interactive prompt:

```solidity
> uint a = 10;
> a * 2
20
```

## üß™ Anvil Seed vs Forge Test Seed
### :pushpin: What‚Äôs Happening:

By default, **Anvil uses the same seed** unless you explicitly specify one. So:

* Every time you manually start Anvil from the terminal, **contracts get the same addresses** (as long as the deployment order stays the same).
* This is convenient for manual testing and development with **hardcoded addresses**.

However, `forge test`:

* Starts its **own internal Anvil-like fork**, and by default uses a **random seed** each time.
* So deployed contract addresses **change every time**, breaking hardcoded assumptions.

---

### :jigsaw: Solutions

:white_check_mark: **Set a custom seed in Anvil:**

```bash
anvil --seed 123
```

> Any number works. This makes addresses deterministic again.

:white_check_mark: **Set seed for `forge test`:**

```bash
forge test --fork-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --ffi --fork-block-number 18000000 --fork-seed 123
```

In practice, people more often use something like:

```bash
forge test --sender 0x... --gas-limit 10000000
```

Or if you‚Äôre using **Forge‚Äôs built-in Anvil**, pass the seed like this:

```bash
forge test --anvil --fork-url http://... --anvil-args "--seed 123"
```

---

### :brain: Recommendations

* **Avoid hardcoding addresses** that are determined during deployment.
  Instead, save them to variables directly in your scripts or tests.

* **Pass the seed explicitly** when you want deterministic results.

* Use `console.log(...)` or [`console2.sol`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/blob/master/src/console2.sol) to **print addresses during deployment**, so you can copy them easily.

---

## üîó Automatic Contract Address Passing Options

### :question: **Question**

> ‚ÄúIs importing the only way to automatically reference another contract‚Äôs address after deployment in a script?‚Äù

**Answer:**
Not at all ‚Äî there are **multiple automated approaches** to pass or retrieve a deployed contract‚Äôs address, and **importing is not required**.

---

### :white_check_mark: **Three Main Approaches**

| # | Method                                     | On-Chain Compatible? | Off-Chain Involved? | Use Case                                                       |
| - | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **Direct assignment in the deploy script** | ‚úÖ Yes                | ‚ùå No                | Single deploy script where contracts are deployed sequentially |
| 2 | **Environment variables (.env, shell)**    | ‚ùå No                 | ‚úÖ Yes               | Reusable CLI deploys or CI pipelines                           |
| 3 | **JSON serialization/deserialization**     | ‚ùå No                 | ‚úÖ Yes               | Multi-step deployments or test setups                          |

---

### :mag_right: **Detailed Breakdown**

---

#### :white_check_mark: 1. Direct assignment within the deploy script (on-chain)

You deploy one contract and immediately use its address in the next deployment:

```solidity
function run() external {
    vm.startBroadcast();

    MockV3Aggregator mock = new MockV3Aggregator(...);
    FundMe fund = new FundMe(address(mock));

    vm.stopBroadcast();
}
```

:green_circle: **Pros**:

* Fully on-chain and atomic
* Clean, self-contained

:red_circle: **Cons**:

* Not modular ‚Äî only works if both contracts are deployed in the same script/run

---

#### :white_check_mark: 2. Passing address via shell or `.env` variables (off-chain)

You pass the address manually (or via a shell script):

```bash
export PRICE_FEED=0xMockAddress
forge script script/DeployFundMe.s.sol:DeployFundMe \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --broadcast \
  --constructor-args $PRICE_FEED
```

You can also load from `.env` using `vm.envAddress(...)` in Solidity:

```solidity
address priceFeed = vm.envAddress("PRICE_FEED");
FundMe fund = new FundMe(priceFeed);
```

:green_circle: **Pros**:

* Good for separating deployments across stages or chains
* Integrates well with CI/CD pipelines

:red_circle: **Cons**:

* Not on-chain ‚Äî depends on external files or user input
* Risk of mismatches if `.env` is outdated or missing

---

#### :white_check_mark: 3. Serialize & deserialize address using JSON (off-chain)

You write the deployed address into a `.json` file, and read it later:

**Save (serialize) during deployment:**

```solidity
string memory json = vm.serializeAddress("deploy", "priceFeed", address(mock));
vm.writeJson(json, "./deployments/mock.json");
```

**Load (deserialize) in another script:**

```solidity
address priceFeed = vm.parseJsonAddress("./deployments/mock.json", ".deploy.priceFeed");
FundMe fund = new FundMe(priceFeed);
```

:green_circle: **Pros**:

* Great for multi-script, multi-chain deployments
* Enables reuse of previously deployed contract data

:red_circle: **Cons**:

* Depends on off-chain cheatcodes (`vm.*`)
* Only works inside Foundry scripts, not in production contracts

---

### :pushpin: **Serialization: What Is It?**

**Serialization** is the process of converting a data object (like a contract address) into a storable format (e.g. JSON).
**Deserialization** is the reverse ‚Äî reading the data back into code.

Useful when:

* You need to store results of one deployment to use later
* Avoid hardcoding
* Maintain flexibility across different networks

---

### :white_check_mark: **Which Works On-Chain?**

| Method                     | Works Fully On-Chain? |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Environment variables      | ‚ùå No                  |
| JSON serialization         | ‚ùå No                  |
| Direct constructor passing | ‚úÖ Yes                 |

Only **method #3** (direct address passing in Solidity) is **fully on-chain**, meaning it:

* Doesn‚Äôt depend on external files
* Can run inside a contract, not just in a script

---

### :brain: Best Practices

* Use **direct variable passing** when everything is in one deploy script or transaction.
* Use **`.env` or JSON serialization** when:

  * Deployments are split across steps or teams
  * You want modularity and reuse
  * You're integrating with CI/CD

:white_check_mark: All three methods can be **combined** in large projects.

---

## üß± Abstract Contracts

Just like interfaces, abstract contracts can declare functions without bodies ‚Äî but **unlike** interfaces, they can also include fully implemented functions and storage variables.

They **aren‚Äôt instantiated directly** like regular contracts and **aren‚Äôt used as standalone instances** like interfaces either. Instead, they are **inherited** by other contracts.

Abstract contracts function as templates, but **they don‚Äôt have to appear first in the inheritance chain**. They can serve as intermediate layers and don‚Äôt have to fully implement the parent contract‚Äôs code ‚Äî only the parts that need to be overridden or extended.

### Unexpected (for me) use case:

When I imported `MockV3Aggregator.sol` from the `chainlink-brownie-contracts` library and created my own mock aggregator contract that inherits from it ‚Äî without initializing the constructor arguments ‚Äî the compiler gave me two options:

* Either rewrite the constructor and supply the required arguments like in the parent contract;
* Or **mark my new contract as `abstract`**, effectively skipping the need to define the constructor.

Here‚Äôs the Solidity code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/tests/MockV3Aggregator.sol";

abstract contract MyMockV3Aggregator is MockV3Aggregator {
    function version() public pure override returns (uint256) {
        return 1;
    }
}
```

> :wrench: This won‚Äôt compile as-is ‚Äî the `version()` function tries to override a `public constant uint256` variable, which has an automatically generated getter. You **can‚Äôt override it with a function**.

Still, this example serves to illustrate how marking a contract `abstract` allows you to bypass the need to supply constructor arguments immediately ‚Äî useful for structuring or extending contracts during development or testing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overrridable Functions From Parent Contracts

### The word `virtual` in a function's signature means it can be overridden by the faunction with the same name in a child contract. To do this, mark it as `override`.

**Below are examples of inheritance control:**

```solidity
contract A {
    function foo() public virtual {}
}

contract B is A {
    function foo() public override {}
}
```

For multiple inheritance:

```solidity
contract C is A, B {
    function foo() public override(A, B) {}
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Assembly & Yul Basics

### low-level EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) assembly code

The `assembly { ... }` block in Solidity allows you to write **low-level EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) assembly code** directly inside your smart contract. It gives you **fine-grained control** over how things are stored and executed, bypassing high-level Solidity syntax.

Let‚Äôs break down what‚Äôs happening in your example:

---

#### :wrench: `assemblyStore`

```solidity
function assemblyStore(uint256 newNumber) external {
    assembly {
        sstore(0x00, newNumber)
    }
}
```

This uses **Yul assembly** to directly store the value `newNumber` into **storage slot `0x00`**.

* `sstore(key, value)` ‚Üí stores `value` at `key` in **contract storage**
* `0x00` ‚Üí this is storage slot `0`, which is where `myNumberOne` is stored by default in Solidity

:bulb: This line is equivalent to:

```solidity
myNumberOne = newNumber;
```

but done manually via assembly.

---

This function returns a value using assembly:

```solidity
function assemblyView() external view returns (uint256 result) {
    assembly {
        result := sload(0x00)
    }
}
```

Or if you want to use `return()` manually:

```solidity
function assemblyView() external view returns (uint256) {
    assembly {
        let value := sload(0x00)
        mstore(0x00, value)
        return(0x00, 0x20)
    }
}
```

---

#### :warning: Summary:

* `assembly {}` lets you write EVM instructions directly (Yul language).
* `sstore` and `sload` manipulate storage manually.
* `mstore` and `return` are for working with memory and returning raw values.
* Use with care: errors are easier to make and harder to debug than in normal Solidity.

---

### :test_tube: What is Yul?

Yul is a **low-level intermediate language** used by the Solidity compiler for optimization.

* Introduced after Solidity 0.6.x as a **cleaner alternative to legacy inline assembly**
* Used inside `assembly {}` blocks
* Shared across multiple EVM targets (EVM, eWASM)

#### Common Yul Opcodes

| Opcode                  | Purpose               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| `sstore(slot, value)`   | Write to storage      |
| `sload(slot)`           | Read from storage     |
| `mstore(offset, value)` | Write to memory       |
| `mload(offset)`         | Read from memory      |
| `return(offset, size)`  | Return memory segment |

#### Yul Syntax Example:

```solidity
function getVal() public view returns (uint256 result) {
    assembly {
        result := sload(0x0)
    }
}
```

* `:=` is assignment
* All operations are done in slots or memory offsets

---

#### :vs: Yul vs Old Assembly

Before Yul:

```solidity
assembly {
    let x := calldataload(4)
}
```

Now with Yul:

* Syntax is more structured
* Control flow and variable handling are cleaner
* Easier for the compiler to optimize

---

#### :warning: When to Use Yul?

Use Yul if you need:

* **Gas savings**
* Access to **EVM internals**
* **Low-level memory tricks**

But be careful:

* **Harder to test & audit**
* Easier to introduce **bugs**, **invariant violations**, or **reentrancy**
* Avoid unless necessary ‚Äî or you're building critical low-level primitives

## üß† Solidity `memory` vs `storage` ‚Äî Deep Dive Summary

*Originally sparked by a message shared on my smart contract auditing Discord server ‚ÄπùîΩùï†ùï¶ùïüùïïùï£ùï™ & ùîΩùï¶ùï£ùï™‚Ä∫ üõ°‚öîüî•*

### üìå Core Understanding

In Solidity, when a user (EOA or another contract) interacts with a public function and passes in variables, **those variables are copied into memory**, not passed by reference ‚Äî for **safety and integrity**.

#### Key Principle:

> **External callers must not be allowed to directly access or mutate contract's internal state (i.e., storage variables).**

---

### üß± Data Location Keywords

| Keyword    | Description                                                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `memory`   | Temporary, modifiable, and erased after function call. Used for isolation. |
| `storage`  | Permanent, persistent on-chain data. Default for state variables.          |
| `calldata` | Immutable, cheaper than memory. Used for external function inputs.         |

---

### üßÆ Simple vs Reference (Pointer) Types

* **Simple data types** (e.g., `uint`, `bool`, `address`):

  * Are **copied** when passed to functions.
  * No special keywords needed (`memory` is implied).
  * Fully safe: changes don‚Äôt affect the original variable.

* **Reference types** (e.g., `arrays`, `strings`, `structs`, `mappings`):

  * Require **explicit data location** in function parameters.
  * Can be expensive to copy ‚Üí by default, `storage` references are passed within internal functions, but must be handled cautiously.

---

### üß¨ Arrays, Strings, Mappings

#### Arrays & Strings

* Stored as **reference types**.
* If you pass an array to a `public` function, **you must copy it into `memory`**.
* This copy is **isolated**: changes won‚Äôt affect the original.
* In contrast, if you use an internal function and explicitly use `storage`, the original will be mutated.

#### Mappings

* Mappings cannot be passed as `memory` or `calldata`. Solidity **only supports `storage`** for mappings.
* But they are **modifiable** via external functions *indirectly*:

  * You pass a key to the mapping through a function.
  * The function uses that key to access and update the original `storage` mapping.

---

### üîê ABI Limitations

* You **cannot** pass a `storage` variable (like a contract's array or mapping) directly to a public/external function ‚Äî **this would break encapsulation**.
* The ABI (Application Binary Interface) **doesn‚Äôt support referencing contract-internal structures** from the outside.

That‚Äôs why you can:

* Pass a number (a key) to access a `mapping`.
* Not pass an array and expect to mutate it ‚Äî instead, operate internally or via index-based setters.

---

### üîÅ Shared References: Power & Danger

#### Why They're Useful:

* Efficient memory usage.
* Enable modifying the same object in multiple places.

#### Why They're Dangerous:

* Unexpected side effects (you modify it in one place, it changes elsewhere).
* Especially risky with **mutable** data types (like arrays/dicts).
* In Solidity, can cause **security risks** (e.g., if internal state is exposed or manipulated carelessly).

---

### üßπ GC & Immutability (From Python Parallels)

* **GC = Garbage Collector** ‚Äì automatically frees memory not referenced anymore.
* Immutable types like Python strings (`"apple"`) are safe to share.
* But **mutable** types like `list` or Solidity `storage` variables must be handled cautiously.

Changing `"apple"` to `"banana"` just changes a reference ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt modify the original object. Shared references only matter for **mutable** data.

---

### üìé TL;DR

* Solidity enforces **data safety** between contract and caller by copying inputs to `memory`.
* Arrays, strings, and mappings behave like **pointers** and can lead to shared state if not handled right.
* **Only internal functions** can work directly with `storage` pointers.
* Shared references are powerful but must be **explicitly managed** to avoid bugs or vulnerabilities.

---

## ü™ô Solidity‚Äôs Philosophy: Flat, Deterministic, Transparent

### ‚úÖ 1. **Storage layout in Solidity is deterministic and local**

In Solidity:

* All storage variables live at a specific slot in the contract‚Äôs storage (not some central registry).
* Structs and arrays are **encoded into sequential slots** (offset-based).
* You can predict and compute where any element is stored.

üìå There‚Äôs **no indirection layer** (like a global pointer map) because:

* That would require more storage lookups,
* More complex reads/writes,
* And potentially more gas.

> Solidity prioritizes **explicit storage layout** over abstract pointer management.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **It avoids hidden shared state**

If arrays or structs automatically pointed to some global object, **unexpected shared references** would become common:

* You‚Äôd copy an array,
* Change it,
* And accidentally change the original.

This is dangerous in a smart contract where **immutability and transparency** are key.

So Solidity instead:

* Forces **explicit behavior** (copy or reference),
* With no hidden references unless you ask for it (by using `storage`).

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Gas cost and simplicity**

Managing a global reference map (as in Python‚Äôs object model or Java‚Äôs heap) would:

* Require an internal GC (garbage collection),
* Add runtime complexity,
* And be *massively gas-inefficient*.

Solidity‚Äôs storage model is flat and manual by design.

---

### üß† Mental Model

Think of Solidity like this:

* Every variable lives **either in storage or memory** (or calldata).
* Reference types like arrays point to **a region of memory or storage**, not some abstract ID.
* If you copy them, you're either:

  * Making a **new memory copy** (independent), or
  * Creating a **new reference to existing storage** (shared).

There‚Äôs no in-between.

---

### üîß Example

```solidity
contract Example {
    uint[] public numbers;

    function setNumbers() public {
        numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    }

    function modify() public {
        uint[] storage ref = numbers; // Shared reference
        ref[0] = 999; // changes `numbers[0]` directly
    }

    function modifyCopy() public {
        uint[] memory copy = numbers; // New memory copy
        copy[0] = 888; // `numbers[0]` remains 999
    }
}
```

No global table, no IDs ‚Äî just **you saying**: ‚ÄúI want to work with storage‚Äù or ‚Äúgive me a copy.‚Äù

---

### üîí Why that‚Äôs a good thing in smart contracts?

* Prevents **accidental shared state bugs**
* Gives developers **tight control** over costs and behavior
* Makes behavior **predictable and auditable**

---

If Solidity had a global pointer table, it would be more like Python or JavaScript ‚Äî but that would be **dangerous, expensive, and unpredictable** in the context of Ethereum.

---

### Python (and similar):

words = ["apple", "banana", "apple"]

Memory:
words ‚Üí [ref, ref, ref]
         ‚Üì    ‚Üì    ‚Üì
     "apple" "banana"
         ‚Üë
   (shared reference)

---

### Solidity:

string[] words = ["apple", "banana", "apple"]

Storage:
+--------+--------------+
| Slot 0 | length: 3    |
| Slot 1 | "apple"      | ‚Üê full independent storage
| Slot 2 | "banana"     |
| Slot 3 | "apple"      | ‚Üê another full copy
+--------+--------------+

---

### üëæ 4. Concurrency in Other Languages

In concurrent or multithreaded environments (e.g., Java, C++), shared references to mutable data can lead to:

    Race conditions (two threads modify same data at once),

    Deadlocks, or

    Hard-to-find bugs due to state mutation from "somewhere else".

---

### Best Practice Summary

| Context                | Risk of Shared Reference     | Safer Alternative                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Python lists/dicts     | Unintended mutation          | Use `.copy()` or `copy.deepcopy()`      |
| Solidity storage       | Permanent global mutation    | Work with `memory` or `calldata`        |
| Concurrency (Java/C++) | Race conditions / corruption | Locks, immutability, thread-safe design |

---

## GC stands for **Garbage Collection**.

It‚Äôs a **memory management technique** used in many high-level programming languages (like Python, Java, JavaScript) to **automatically find and clean up** data in memory that is no longer needed.

---

### üîß How It Works (Simplified):

When you create objects (like lists, strings, etc.), they take up memory (RAM).
If you're no longer using those objects, the **garbage collector** (GC) finds them and frees that memory so it can be reused.

---

### üß† Example in Python:

```python
def make_list():
    a = [1, 2, 3]
    return "done"

make_list()
# The list [1, 2, 3] is no longer referenced ‚Üí GC will delete it
```

You don‚Äôt need to manually delete `a` ‚Äî Python's GC will handle it for you.

---

### üö´ Solidity Has No GC

Solidity (and EVM in general) does **not** have garbage collection because:

* Smart contract data is stored **on-chain** in **permanent storage**.
* Storage is **manually managed** ‚Äî you explicitly set, update, or delete it.
* Deleting a storage variable even **refunds gas**, because storage space is valuable.

So in Solidity, *you* are responsible for removing data with statements like:

```solidity
delete myMapping[key];
```

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Feature                 | High-level languages (Python, JS) | Solidity (EVM)           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Has Garbage Collection? | ‚úÖ Yes                             | ‚ùå No                     |
| Who manages memory?     | Runtime/GC system                 | You (the developer)      |
| Cost of memory?         | üß† RAM, cleared automatically     | ‚õìÔ∏è Persistent, costs gas |

---

## Public/External vs Private/Internal functions and variables.

Let's clarify how **function visibility** and **state variable access** relate to each other in Solidity:

---

### ‚úÖ **State variable access rules** are **based on scope**, not function visibility.

* A `public` or `external` **function** **can access** `private` or `internal` **state variables** **as long as** the function is **within the same contract**.
* The **caller (EOA)** does **not** directly access state variables ‚Äî they **call functions**.
* So **public functions *can* read or write private variables**, because the compiler checks where the function is defined, **not** who‚Äôs calling it.

---

### üìå Example:

```solidity
contract Example {
    uint private secret;

    function setSecret(uint _value) public {
        secret = _value; // ‚úÖ allowed: function is in the same contract
    }

    function getSecret() public view returns (uint) {
        return secret; // ‚úÖ allowed: same scope
    }
}
```

Even though `secret` is `private`, `setSecret()` and `getSecret()` can access it ‚Äî because they live **in the same contract**.

---

### üîí What does `private` actually mean for variables?

* It means **only this contract** can access the variable.
* Even **derived contracts (child contracts)** can't access it.
* It's a **compile-time restriction**, not a runtime one.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è But if you want to prevent **EOA** (users) from triggering the function that changes sensitive state:

* Make the function itself `internal` or `private`.
* Or use access control modifiers like `onlyOwner`.

---

### ‚úÖ TL;DR:

> **You do not need to make a function private just because it accesses a private variable.**
> What matters is **where the function is declared** ‚Äî not its visibility.

Great question ‚Äî let's walk through this precisely.

---

### ‚úÖ **When a state variable is marked `public` in Solidity:**

Solidity **automatically generates a getter function** for that variable.

So:

```solidity
uint public myVar;
```

Is **roughly equivalent to**:

```solidity
function myVar() public view returns (uint) {
    return myVar;
}
```

---

### üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Can an **EOA (Externally Owned Account)** access `myVar`?

Yes ‚Äî **but only via the autogenerated getter**.
They **cannot directly access storage**, but they **can call the getter function** and receive the current value.

> üß† Think of it this way:
> EOAs **cannot ‚Äúreach into‚Äù storage**, but they **can call public functions** that expose parts of it.

---

### ü§ñ Can another **contract** access `myVar`?

Also yes ‚Äî via the same **public getter**.

If contract A declares:

```solidity
uint public balance;
```

Then contract B can do:

```solidity
uint otherBalance = AContractInstance.balance();
```

Again, this is just calling the autogenerated getter ‚Äî **not directly reaching into raw storage**.

---

### üîê But can either of them **mutate** `balance`?

Not directly. To **modify** a state variable, you must call a function (public/internal/etc.) that contains mutation logic:

```solidity
function setBalance(uint _val) public {
    balance = _val;
}
```

And again ‚Äî you control who can call that function using `public`, `private`, `onlyOwner`, etc.

---

### ‚úÖ TL;DR:

| Actor             | Can **read** `public` variable? | Can **write** it?                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| EOA               | ‚úÖ (via getter)                  | ‚ùå (unless a setter function exists) |
| External contract | ‚úÖ (via getter)                  | ‚ùå (unless a setter function exists) |
| Internal function | ‚úÖ (directly)                    | ‚úÖ (directly)                        |

### ‚úÖ When a state variable is marked public in Solidity:

Solidity automatically generates a getter function for that variable.

So:

```solidity
uint public myVar;
```

Is roughly equivalent to:

```solidity
function myVar() public view returns (uint) {
    return myVar;
}
```

---

## üî∏ What immutables are used for:

**Immutables** are typically used to store values that are known **only at the time of deployment** ‚Äî often provided via the **constructor** ‚Äî and **never change afterward**.

### üîπ So, where do these values come from?

1. ‚úÖ **Constructor arguments**:
   The deployer sends these **as calldata** during deployment.

   ```solidity
   contract Example {
       address immutable owner;

       constructor(address _owner) {
           owner = _owner; // set once
       }
   }
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Hardcoded by deployer**:
   Sometimes the constructor may use logic (e.g., `msg.sender`, `block.timestamp`) instead of explicit parameters.

   ```solidity
   contract TimeLock {
       uint256 immutable deployedAt;

       constructor() {
           deployedAt = block.timestamp;
       }
   }
   ```

---

### üî∏ So to your question:

> Are immutables used *only* for calldata which the deployer sends with the contract itself to the chain?

**Not only**, but **mainly**. The most common usage is to store constructor arguments sent by the deployer. But they can also store **any value determinable during deployment**, even if not explicitly passed in as calldata.

### TL;DR:

* ‚úÖ **Often set via constructor calldata**
* ‚úÖ **Can also be set using deployment-time context (`msg.sender`, `block.number`, etc.)**
* üö´ **Cannot be changed after deployment**
* üü© **Efficient alternative to `storage` for "set-once" variables**

---

## ‚úÖ When you import an interface in Solidity...

You're telling the compiler:
**"This is the structure (function signatures) of some contract that already exists at a known address."**
Interfaces contain **no implementation**, just function declarations.

---

### ‚úÖ You have two main ways to use an interface:

#### 1. **Imperative (State Variable Style)**

You *declare* the interface as a state variable and *initialize it immediately* with a contract address:

```solidity
IMyInterface public myContract = IMyInterface(0x123...abc);
```

* `IMyInterface`: the interface type
* `0x123...abc`: the address of the deployed contract this interface refers to

> üß† This way you're setting a fixed address once and for all (or for some context), and then you can reuse it through the contract.

---

#### 2. **Via a Function Call (Dynamic Style)**

You can also use the interface inside a function, **without setting it ahead of time**:

```solidity
function interact(address someAddress) public {
    IMyInterface temp = IMyInterface(someAddress);
    temp.doSomething();
}
```

* Here you're creating a *temporary pointer* to the external contract at runtime.
* It‚Äôs dynamic and depends on the `someAddress` provided to the function.
* You're not storing it ‚Äî just using it on the fly.

> üß† You **don‚Äôt need to provide an address beforehand**, because the address will be passed in at runtime when the function is called.

---

### üîç Why the difference?

| Style              | When Address Needed | Stored? | Use Case            |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| **State variable** | Immediately         | Yes     | Static reference    |
| **Function local** | At function call    | No      | Dynamic interaction |

So in summary:

> You must assign the interface to a contract address **before using it** ‚Äî but *how and when* you assign it depends on whether you do it as a state variable (immediately) or inside a function (dynamically).

---

### Since IMyInterface is not a contract type with a constructor or internal logic ‚Äî it's a reference-only abstraction.

So when you‚Äôre telling the compiler:

> "At this address, assume there's a contract implementing the functions defined in this interface."

If you don‚Äôt provide an address at some point, the compiler can‚Äôt resolve what code you‚Äôre referencing.

### ‚úÖ Summary

In Solidity, **you cannot instantiate a state variable of interface type without providing an address** ‚Äî because interfaces are just **views** into existing deployed contracts. They don‚Äôt exist on their own; they don‚Äôt have code or storage.

---

### üî¥ So this **won‚Äôt compile**:

```solidity
IMyInterface public myContract;
```

Unless you initialize it later in the constructor or in a function:

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    IMyInterface public myContract;

    constructor(address _addr) {
        myContract = IMyInterface(_addr);
    }
}
```

Or assign it in a function:

```solidity
function setAddress(address _addr) public {
    myContract = IMyInterface(_addr);
}
```

---

### üß† Why?

Because `IMyInterface` is **not a contract type** with a constructor or internal logic ‚Äî it's a **reference-only abstraction**. You‚Äôre telling the compiler:

> "At this address, assume there's a contract implementing the functions defined in this interface."

So if you don‚Äôt provide an address at some point, the compiler can‚Äôt resolve what code you‚Äôre referencing.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Attempt                                                      | Valid? | Reason                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `IMyInterface public x;`                                     | ‚ùå      | No address = no reference = no contract to talk to  |
| `IMyInterface public x = IMyInterface(addr);`                | ‚úÖ      | Address is given immediately                        |
| `IMyInterface public x;` in contract + assign in constructor | ‚úÖ      | Delayed init, but address still provided eventually |

---

### Example:

// Assume this is in a separate file or imported
interface IToken {
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
}

contract TokenReader {
    IToken public token;

    // Not a constructor ‚Äî just a regular function
    function setTokenAddress(address _token) public {
        token = IToken(_token);
    }

    function getSupply() public view returns (uint256) {
        return token.totalSupply(); // works only after `setTokenAddress()` is called
    }
}

#### üß† Important Notes:

- You‚Äôre still required to assign the address before calling any methods on the interface.

- Until token is assigned, trying to call token.totalSupply() will revert (because token defaults to address(0)).

- This gives flexibility to set or change the address at runtime instead of hardcoding it.

---

## SO FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ME, THE SUMMARY:

- Public/internal state variables is about visibility and NOT mutability. Public here means automatically created getter for an EOA to resort to.
- There's no setter however until a developer creates one him/herself! There's no template or standard, it's just the naming of a category of functions.
- Public/External functions are those acessible for the EOA to call (for example with cast call).
- Public/External functions can't take in the contract's storage variables as arguments.
- However they can mutate them if these mutations are hardcoded into a function's body, cuz it's the developer's deliberate action! Even if Dangerous!
- In such case the element to mutate was pre-determined, in case with passing storage variable as a functio argument - some arbitrary array in the storage can be changed unpredictebly!
- Simple variable types (e.g., `uint`, `bool`, `address`) are fully copied by default when passed to functions, as copying them is cheap. However, we can explicitly specify that we want to access the original storage variable using a `storage` reference (in internal functions).
- Complex types (e.g., arrays, structs, mappings) are treated as reference types. When passed to functions, we must explicitly specify the data location‚Äî`memory` (a copy) or `storage` (a reference to the original data).

##EVEN FURTHER CLARIFICATION, OUTSIDE FUNCTIONS:

### ‚úÖ **Simple Types (like `uint`, `bool`)**

* **Always fully copied** when assigned.
* You can freely assign them to new variables anywhere ‚Äî inside functions or between storage and memory ‚Äî and it creates a full, independent copy.

---

### ‚úÖ **Reference Types (arrays, structs, mappings)**

#### üí† Inside functions:

* You must **explicitly** choose `memory` or `storage` when declaring variables of reference type inside functions.
* `memory` creates a **copy** (temporary and isolated).
* `storage` creates a **reference** to existing storage data.

#### üí† Outside functions (e.g., in contract scope):

* You can **only** declare reference types in **storage** ‚Äî that is, persistent state variables.
* You **cannot** use `memory` outside of function bodies.

## üß™ What happens when you copy an array in storage?

Example:

```solidity
uint[] public original = [1, 2, 3];
uint[] public copy;

function cloneArray() public {
    copy = original;
}
```

In this case, **`copy = original;` creates a full, independent copy** of the array in **storage**. After this, modifying `copy[0]` will **not** affect `original[0]`.

‚úÖ So yes ‚Äî **if you assign a storage array to another storage array, it is a full deep copy**.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è However:

* If you assign a **storage pointer** to another variable using `=`, and both point to the same object, **modifying one will affect the other**.
* To **avoid unintended reference**, avoid using `storage` references unless needed.

Example of reference behavior:

```solidity
function dangerous() internal {
    uint[] storage ref = original;
    ref[0] = 42; // Modifies original!
}
```

### ChatGPT answers my question about `=` + `storage` keyword inside a function (shared reference):

Exactly right.

When you write:

```solidity
uint[] storage ref = original;
```

You're **not copying** `original` ‚Äî you're creating a **new storage reference** (`ref`) that **points to the same data** in storage as `original`. So:

* ‚úÖ `ref` is not a new array.
* ‚úÖ It‚Äôs a **reference (alias)** to `original`.
* ‚úÖ Any change to `ref` affects `original`.

üìå Reference ‚Üí same hash ‚Üí same slot.
üì¶ Copy ‚Üí new hash ‚Üí new slot.

### Contrast with this:

```solidity
copy = original;
```

This creates a **brand-new, independent storage array** called `copy`, and **copies the contents** of `original` into it. After this:

* Changes to `copy` **don‚Äôt** affect `original`.
* It‚Äôs a full **deep copy**, not a reference.

---

So, you're right ‚Äî the presence of the `storage` keyword **within a function**, used like this:

```solidity
uint[] storage ref = original;
```

means: *‚ÄúMake a reference to an existing storage array.‚Äù*

This is different from assigning one storage array to another storage array variable directly (which triggers a full copy).
