## **📚Vulnerability Resources:**
- DeFi Exploits Wiki,
- Secureum Learn,
- the Rareskills auditing course (paid but very strong),
- hack analyses on [rekt.news](https://rekt.news), recreate exploits on a local network, and write at least one intentionally vulnerable smart contract, then “break” it yourself.
